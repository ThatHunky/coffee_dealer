# Local database setup with Docker and .gitignore (2025-10-11 12:38Z)

_**User (2025-10-11 12:39Z)**_

database should be local in the repo folder, keep in mind. Adjust the docker compose and add `.gitignore` files.

I'll help you adjust the docker-compose to use a local database in the repo folder and add a `.gitignore` file. Let me first check the current docker-compose configuration. Now let me check if there's an existing `.gitignore` file: Perfect! Now I'll make the necessary adjustments:

1. **Update `docker-compose.yml`** to ensure the database is stored in a local `data/` folder in the repo
2. **Update .gitignore** to ignore the `data/` folder (but keep the folder structure) 
```

```
Now let me update the `.env` file to match the docker-compose configuration: 
```

```
Now let me create a `.gitkeep` file in the data directory to ensure the folder structure is preserved in git: Now let me update the `.gitignore` to allow the `.gitkeep` file: 
```

```
Perfect! I've made the following changes:

## ✅ Changes Made:

### 1. **Updated `.gitignore`**
   - Added `` directory to be ignored (so database files won't be committed)
   - Added exception for `.gitkeep` to preserve the folder structure in git

### 2. **Updated `.env`**
   - Changed `DATABASE_URL` from `sqlite:///./schedule.db` to `sqlite:///./data/schedule.db`
   - Now matches the docker-compose configuration

### 3. **Created `` folder structure**
   - Created the `` directory in the repo
   - Added `.gitkeep` file to ensure the folder is tracked in git while its contents are ignored

### 4. **Docker Compose**
   - Already configured correctly with:
     - Volume mount: `./data:/app/data`
     - Database path: `sqlite:///./data/schedule.db`

Now your database will be stored locally in the `` folder within your repo, it won't be committed to git (keeping sensitive data safe), but the folder structure will be preserved for other developers.
